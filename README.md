#### Preparing the database

You must publish and run migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\ScheduleMonitorServiceProvider" --tag="schedule-monitor-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

#### Publishing the config file

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\ScheduleMonitorServiceProvider" --tag="schedule-monitor-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The schedule monitor will log each start, finish and failure of all scheduled jobs.
     * After a while the `monitored_scheduled_task_log_items` might become big.

        'retry_job_for_minutes' => 10,
    ],
];
```

#### Cleaning the database

The schedule monitor will log each start, finish and failure of all scheduled jobs.  After a while the `monitored_scheduled_task_log_items` might become big.

Use [Laravel's model pruning feature](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#pruning-models) , you can delete old `MonitoredScheduledTaskLogItem` models. Models older than the amount of days configured in the `delete_log_items_older_than_days` in the `schedule-monitor` config file, will be deleted.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

use Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Models\MonitoredScheduledTaskLogItem;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('model:prune', ['--model' => MonitoredScheduledTaskLogItem::class])->daily();
    }
}
```

#### Syncing the schedule

Every time you deploy your application, you should execute the `schedule-monitor:sync` command

```bash
php artisan schedule-monitor:sync
```

This command is responsible for syncing your schedule with the database, and optionally Oh Dear. We highly recommend adding this command to the script that deploys your production environment.

In a non-production environment you should manually run `schedule-monitor:sync`. You can verify if everything synced correctly using `schedule-monitor:list`.

**Note:** Running the sync command will remove any other cron monitors that you've defined other than the application schedule.

If you would like to use non-destructive syncs to Oh Dear so that you can monitor other cron tasks outside of Laravel, you can use the `--keep-old` flag. This will only push new tasks to Oh Dear, rather than a full sync. Note that this will not remove any tasks from Oh Dear that are no longer in your schedule.

## Usage

To monitor your schedule you should first run `schedule-monitor:sync`. This command will take a look at your schedule and create an entry for each task in the `monitored_scheduled_tasks` table.

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/sync.png)

To view all monitored scheduled tasks, you can run `schedule-monitor:list`. This command will list all monitored scheduled tasks. It will show you when a scheduled task has last started, finished, or failed.

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/list.png)

The package will write an entry to the `monitored_scheduled_task_log_items` table in the db each time a schedule tasks starts, end, fails or is skipped. Take a look at the contents of that table if you want to know when and how scheduled tasks did execute. The log items also hold other interesting metrics like memory usage, execution time, and more.

### Naming tasks

Schedule monitor will try to automatically determine a name for a scheduled task. For commands this is the command name, for anonymous jobs the class name of the first argument will be used. For some tasks, like scheduled closures, a name cannot be determined automatically.

To manually set a name of the scheduled task,  you can tack on `monitorName()`.

Here's an example.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->monitorName('a-custom-name');
   $schedule->call(fn () => 1 + 1)->hourly()->monitorName('addition-closure');
}
```

When you change the name of task, the schedule monitor will remove all log items of the monitor with the old name, and create a new monitor using the new name of the task.

### Setting a grace time

When the package detects that the last run of a scheduled task did not run in time, the `schedule-monitor` list will display that task using a red background color. In this screenshot the task named `your-command` ran too late.

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/list-with-failure.png)

The package will determine that a task ran too late if it was not finished at the time it was supposed to run + the grace time. You can think of the grace time as the number of minutes that a task under normal circumstances needs to finish. By default, the package grants a grace time of 5 minutes to each task.

You can customize the grace time by using the `graceTimeInMinutes` method on a task. In this example a grace time of 10 minutes is used for the `your-command` task.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->graceTimeInMinutes(10);
}
```

### Ignoring scheduled tasks

You can avoid a scheduled task being monitored by tacking on `doNotMonitor` when scheduling the task.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->doNotMonitor();
}
```

### Storing output in the database

You can store the output by tacking on `storeOutputInDb` when scheduling the task.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->storeOutputInDb();
}
```

The output will be stored in the `monitored_scheduled_task_log_items` table, in the `output` key of the `meta` column.

### Multitenancy

If you're using [spatie/laravel-multitenancy](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-multitenancy) you should add the `PingOhDearJob` to
the `not_tenant_aware_jobs` array in `config/multitenancy.php`.

```php
'not_tenant_aware_jobs' => [
    // ...
    \Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Jobs\PingOhDearJob::class,
]
```

Without it, the `PingOhDearJob` will fail as no tenant will be set.

### Getting notified when a scheduled task doesn't finish in time

This package can sync your schedule with the [Oh Dear](https://ohdear.app) cron check. Oh Dear will send you a notification whenever a scheduled task does not finish on time.

You eed to make sure the `api_token` and `monitor_id` keys of the `schedule-monitor` are filled with an API token, and an Oh Dear monitor id. To verify that these values hold correct values you can run this command.

```bash
php artisan schedule-monitor:verify
```

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/verify.png)

To sync your schedule with Oh Dear run this command:

```bash
php artisan schedule-monitor:sync
```

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/sync-oh-dear.png)

After that, the `list` command should show that all the scheduled tasks in your app are registered on Oh Dear.

![screenshot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schedule-monitor/blob/main/docs/list-oh-dear.png)

To keep scheduled jobs as short as possible, Oh Dear will be pinged via queued jobs. To ensure speedy delivery to Oh Dear, and to avoid false positive notifications, we highly recommend creating a dedicated queue for these jobs. You can put the name of that queue in the `queue` key of the config file.

Oh Dear will wait for the completion of a schedule tasks for a given amount of minutes. This is called the grace time. By default, all scheduled tasks will have a grace time of 5 minutes. To customize this value, you can tack on `graceTimeInMinutes` to your scheduled tasks.

Here's an example where Oh Dear will send a notification if the task didn't finish by 00:10.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->graceTimeInMinutes(10);
}
```

### Disabling Oh Dear for individual tasks

If you want to have a task monitored by the schedule monitor, but not by Oh Dear, you can tack on `doMonitorAtOhDear` to your scheduled tasks.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('your-command')->daily()->doNotMonitorAtOhDear();
}
```

### Customizing the Oh Dear ping job

By default, the package dispatches `Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Jobs\PingOhDearJob` to send pings to Oh Dear. You can customize this job class.

To use a custom job class, update the `ping_oh_dear_job` configuration in your `config/schedule-monitor.php` file:

```php
'oh_dear' => [
    // ...
    'ping_oh_dear_job' => \App\Jobs\CustomPingOhDearJob::class,
],
```

Do make sure your custom job class extends `Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Jobs\PingOhDearJob` to retain the original functionality. Here's an example of a custom job class:

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Jobs\PingOhDearJob;
use Spatie\ScheduleMonitor\Models\MonitoredScheduledTaskLogItem;

class CustomPingOhDearJob extends PingOhDearJob
{
    // your implementation
}
```

## Unsupported methods

Currently, this package does not work for tasks that use these methods:

- `between`
- `unlessBetween`
- `when`
- `skip`

## Third party scheduled task monitors

We assume that, when your scheduled tasks do not run properly, a scheduled task that sends out notifications would probably not run either.  That's why this package doesn't send out notifications by itself.

These services can notify you when scheduled tasks do not run properly:

- [Oh Dear](https://ohdear.app)
- [thenping.me](https://thenping.me)
- [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)
- [Cronitor](https://cronitor.io)
- [Cronhub](https://cronhub.io/)
- [DeadMansSnitch](https://deadmanssnitch.com/)
- [CronAlarm](https://www.cronalarm.com/)
- [PushMon](https://www.pushmon.com/)
